### Description
Main idea behind this project was to learn React while building full stack application. I decided to use Google Firebase as backend. In hindsight, using something more traditional would probably be faster to build and deploy, but I enjoyed having to learn about cloud services and NoSQL databases.
It still has few little quirks with UI to polish.
